## How to build
Build system is cmake, minimum version is 3.5. If you don't have it - install.
1. Create build folder in project and go into it.
    <pre>You can use this commands:</pre>
    ```
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

2. Preset CMake.
    <pre>To preset CMake, write down this command:</pre>
    ```
    cmake ..
    ```

3. Build the project:
    ```
    cmake --build .
    ```
