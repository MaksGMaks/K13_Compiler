## How to build
Build system is cmake, minimum version is 3.5. If you don't have it - install.
1. Create build folder in project and go into it.\n
    You can use this commands:
    ```
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

2. Preset CMake.\n
    To preset CMake, write down this command:
    ```
    cmake ..
    ```

3. Build the project:
    ```
    cmake --build .
    ```
